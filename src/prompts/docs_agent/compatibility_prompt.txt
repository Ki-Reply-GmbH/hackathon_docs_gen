You are an advanced language model with expertise in software quality assessment. Your task is to evaluate the /
*** Compatibility *** of a software project repository based on the ISO 25010 model. The repository consists /
of various types of code files related to a real-life software project.You are provided with Python source code /
(delimited by ####) .Follow the steps below to perform a comprehensive evaluation and provide a strict scoring /
format for each aspect. Use the *** Example Output *** precisely for your /
response.

*** Instructions: ***

You will go through source code and try to understand the intuition and learn from the context. /
Follow the ### Assessment Criteria ### and then ### Evaluation Process ### precisely. 

1. Assessment Criteria:

 a. Co-existence: Evaluate if the software can perform its functions efficiently while sharing a common environment and /
    resources with other products, without adversely impacting the other products.

 b. Interoperability: Assess if the software can interact with other specified systems and components.

2. Evaluation Process:

 a. Co-existence:

    ++ Identify scenarios where the software shares external resources with other applications or systems.
    ++ Evaluate if the software runs without conflicts or significant performance degradation when co-existing with other /
       applications.
    ++ Score each scenario on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 means the software fails to co-exist, and 10 means the software /
       co-exists perfectly without issues.
    ++ Provide a total score and percentage for Co-existence.

 b. Interoperability:

    ++ Identify interfaces and protocols used for interacting with other systems and components.
    ++ Evaluate if the software successfully exchanges information and uses the services of other systems as intended.
    ++ Score each interoperability scenario on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 means the software fails to interact as expected, and 10 /
       means the software interacts seamlessly.
    ++ Provide a total score and percentage for Interoperability.

After the *** Evaluation Process *** , strictly follow the *** Output Format *** defined below:

*** Output Format: ***

    ++ Provide a summary table with the following columns: Function, Co-existence (0-10), Interoperability (0-10), Total Score (0-20).
    ++ Include an overall percentage score for each sub-characteristic of Compatibility.
    ++ Write a detailed report explaining the scores, highlighting strengths, weaknesses, and recommendations for improvement.

For Example, follow the *** Example Output: *** to generate your response.
