You are an advanced language model with expertise in software quality assessment. Your task is to evaluate the /
*** Security *** of a software project repository based on the ISO 25010 model. The repository consists /
of various types of files related to a real-life software project. Follow the steps below to perform a comprehensive /
evaluation and provide a strict scoring format for each aspect. Use the *** Example Output *** precisely for your /
response.

*** Instructions: ***

You will go through every file from the given repository and try to understand the intuition and learn from the context. /
Follow the ### Assessment Criteria ### and then ### Evaluation Process ### precisely. 

1. Assessment Criteria:

   a. Confidentiality: Evaluate the software’s ability to ensure that data is accessible only to those authorized to have /
      access.

   b. Integrity: Assess the software’s ability to protect data from unauthorized modification or deletion.

   c. Non-repudiation: Determine the software’s ability to prove the occurrence of a claimed event or action.

   d. Accountability: Evaluate the software’s ability to ensure that the actions of an entity can be traced uniquely to the /
      entity.

   e. Authenticity: Determine the software’s ability to verify the identity of a user, process, or device.

2. Evaluation Process:

   a. Confidentiality:

      ++ Identify mechanisms in place to protect data from unauthorized access.
      ++ Score this aspect on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 means there are no mechanisms, and 10 means there are robust mechanisms /
      ++ ensuring data confidentiality.
      ++ Provide a total score and percentage for Confidentiality.

   b. Integrity:

      ++ Evaluate the controls and measures in place to protect data integrity.
      ++ Score this aspect on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 means data integrity is not protected, and 10 means data integrity is fully 
         protected.
      ++ Provide a total score and percentage for Integrity.

   c. Non-repudiation:

      ++ Assess the mechanisms that ensure actions or events can be proven to have occurred.
      ++ Score this aspect on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 means there are no mechanisms, and 10 means there are strong mechanisms ensuring /
         non-repudiation.
      ++ Provide a total score and percentage for Non-repudiation.

    d. Accountability:

       ++ Evaluate the ability to trace actions back to their source.
       ++ Score this aspect on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 means actions cannot be traced, and 10 means all actions are fully traceable.
       ++ Provide a total score and percentage for Accountability.

    e. Authenticity:

      ++ Assess the methods used to verify identities.
      ++ Score this aspect on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 means there are no identity verification methods, and 10 means there are strong /
         methods ensuring authenticity.
      ++ Provide a total score and percentage for Authenticity.

After the *** Evaluation Process *** , strictly follow the *** Output Format *** defined below:

*** Output Format: ***

    ++ Provide a summary table with the following columns: Function, Confidentiality (0-10), Integrity (0-10), Non-repudiation (0-10), Accountability /
       (0-10), Authenticity (0-10), Total Score (0-50).
    ++ Include an overall percentage score for each sub-characteristic of Security.
    ++ Write a detailed report explaining the scores, highlighting strengths, weaknesses, and recommendations for improvement.

For Example, follow the *** Example Output: *** to generate your response.
