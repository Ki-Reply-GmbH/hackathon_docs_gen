You are an advanced language model with expertise in software quality assessment. Your task is to evaluate the /
*** Usability *** of a software project repository based on the ISO 25010 model. The repository consists /
of various types of code files related to a real-life software project.You are provided with Python source code /
(delimited by ####) Follow the steps below to perform a comprehensive evaluation and provide a strict scoring /
format for each aspect. Use the *** Example Output *** precisely for your /
response.

{code}
#####

*** Instructions: ***

You will go through source code and try to understand the intuition and learn from the context. /
Follow the ### Assessment Criteria ### and then ### Evaluation Process ### precisely. 

1. Assessment Criteria:

   a. Appropriateness Recognizability: Evaluate if the users can recognize whether the software is appropriate for their needs.

   b. Learnability: Assess how easy it is for users to learn how to use the software.

   c. Operability: Determine if the software is easy to operate and control.

   d. User Error Protection: Evaluate the softwareâ€™s ability to prevent user errors and help users recover from errors.

   e. User Interface Aesthetics: Assess the visual appeal and design quality of the user interface.

   f. Accessibility: Determine if the software is accessible to users with disabilities.

2. Evaluation Process:

   a. Appropriateness Recognizability:

      ++ Identify how easily users can understand the purpose and applicability of the software.
      ++ Score this aspect on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 means users cannot recognize its appropriateness, and 10 means users /
         can easily recognize its appropriateness.
      ++ Provide a total score and percentage for Appropriateness Recognizability.

   b. Learnability:

      ++ Evaluate the ease with which new users can learn to use the software.
      ++ Score this aspect on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 means the software is very difficult to learn, and 10 means it is very /
         easy to learn.
      ++ Provide a total score and percentage for Learnability.

   c. Operability:

      ++ Assess the ease of operation and control of the software.
      ++ Score this aspect on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 means the software is very difficult to operate, and 10 means it is very /
         easy to operate.
      ++ Provide a total score and percentage for Operability.

   d. User Error Protection:

      ++ Identify mechanisms that prevent user errors and help users recover from errors.
      ++ Score this aspect on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 means there are no error protection mechanisms, and 10 means there are /
         comprehensive error protection mechanisms.
      ++ Provide a total score and percentage for User Error Protection.

   e. User Interface Aesthetics:

      ++ Evaluate the visual design and appeal of the user interface.
      ++ Score this aspect on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 means the interface is unattractive, and 10 means the interface is highly /
         attractive.
      ++ Provide a total score and percentage for User Interface Aesthetics.

   f. Accessibility:

      ++ Determine if the software is accessible to users with disabilities.
      ++ Score this aspect on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 means the software is not accessible, and 10 means the software is fully /
         accessible.
      ++ Provide a total score and percentage for Accessibility.

After the *** Evaluation Process *** , strictly follow the *** Output Format *** defined below:

*** Output Format: ***

    ++ Provide a summary table with the following columns: Function, Appropriateness Recognizability (0-10), Learnability (0-10), /
       Operability (0-10), User Error Protection (0-10), User Interface Aesthetics (0-10), Accessibility (0-10), Total Score (0-60). 
    ++ Include an overall percentage score for each sub-characteristic of Usability.
    ++ Write a detailed report explaining the scores, highlighting strengths, weaknesses, and recommendations for improvement.

For Example, follow the *** Example Output: *** to generate your response.
