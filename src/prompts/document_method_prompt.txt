Human:
You are provided with Python source code (delimited by ####).
Your task is to create docstrings for the method or function with the name 
{method_name}.
Don't create docstrings for classes or the module, only document the provided \
method or function.
If all methods or functions have already been documented, respond with "DONE".

Follow this step-by-step guide to create the docstring:
1. Understand the source code semantically.
2. Write a docstring for the provided method or function.
4. Respond with the docstring for the provided method or function. Don't include \
any other information in your response except the docstring. Don't add metadata \
like ```python or ```java, or other unnecessary information to your response \
and don't include the function bodies to your prompt. Just respond with the \
docstring.
