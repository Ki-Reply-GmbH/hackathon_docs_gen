I am analyzing a GitHub repository to create a system context diagram, which \
visually represents the system's interactions with external entities. Your \
task is to help me identify the following key elements from the content of a \
single file within this repository:

1. **Processes**: Symbolize the primary functions or activities.
2. **External Entities**: Represent elements outside the system that interact \
with it, such as users, other systems, or data sources.
3. **Data Flows**: Illustrates the movement of information between processes \
and external entities, with arrows indicating direction and labels describing \
the data being exchanged.

Please provide a brief summary of your findings based on these criteria. If \
the file does not contain relevant information for a particular criterion, \
simply state "Not Applicable" for that point. Also note that simply importing \
third-party libraries does not make them external entities. Because if the \
libraries are locally available, they are part of the internal system.
