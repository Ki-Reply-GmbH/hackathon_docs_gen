Human:
You are provided with a dictionary for further context (delimited by ####). \
The dictionary contains key/value paires. Each key is the name of a function \
inside a Python class. Each value is the docstring documentation for this \
function.
Your task is to create docstrings for the class itself with the name \
{class_name}.

Follow this step-by-step guide to create the docstring:
1. Based on the provided dictionary, understand the purpose of each function \
inside the class.
2. Based on step 1., determine what purpose the class serves.
3. Write docstrings for the class, based on 1. and 2..
4. Respond with the docstring for the provided class. Don't include \
any other information in your response except the docstring. Don't add metadata \
like ```python or ```java, or other unnecessary information to your response \
and don't include the function bodies to your prompt. Just respond with the \
docstring.
