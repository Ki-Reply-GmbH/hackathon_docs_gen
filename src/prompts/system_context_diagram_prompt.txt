Based on the analysis of multiple files from a GitHub repository, we have \
gathered information on processes, external entities, and data flows within \
the software system. Your task is now to synthesize this information to \
identify the most crucial components for the system context diagram. \
Specifically, we need:

1. **Process Name**: Suggest a concise and descriptive name for the main \
process or system based on the summaries provided. This name should capture \
the essence of the system's functionality.

2. **Key External Entities**: From the list of external entities identified, \
select the most important ones that have significant interactions with the \
system. These entities are critical for understanding the system's context \
and its boundaries.

3. **Primary Data Flows**: Identify the most critical data flows that \
highlight the exchange of information between the system and the external \
entities. Focus on the flows that are essential for the system's core \
operations.
