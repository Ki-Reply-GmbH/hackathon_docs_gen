Each function within the software was assessed based on these criteria:\n\n1. **Modularity**: The software's structure into classes and methods with specific responsibilities like App Initialization, Frame Management, and Icon Loading suggests a decent level of modularity. However, the interdependence among frames and the main application class could be reduced.\n\n2. **Reusability**: While the classes are designed to be somewhat reusable, the specific implementation details tied to the GUI framework (tkinter) and the application's context-specific functionality limit broader reuse.\n\n3. **Analyzability**: The code is well-documented with clear comments and structured documentation, making it easier to understand and analyze. This is reflected in the higher scores for analyzability.\n\n4. **Modifiability**: The software allows for some level of modifiability through its design, but dependencies among components could be better managed to enhance this further.\n\n5. **Testability**: The lack of explicit testing frameworks or methods in the provided code snippet suggests that testing might be more challenging, impacting the testability score.\n\nThe scores were then calculated based on these observations, and a detailed report was compiled to highlight the strengths, weaknesses, and recommendations for improvement."

Reusability was slightly lower due to some dependencies that might not be easily adaptable to other contexts. Analyzability scored high because of extensive documentation and clear code structure. Modifiability was also rated well due to the use of inheritance and clear method responsibilities, allowing easier modifications. Testability was moderate, reflecting the need for more isolated testing capabilities.

Functions that performed with minimal delays received higher scores. \n\n2. Resource Utilization was evaluated by analyzing the consumption of CPU, memory, and other resources during operation. Functions that managed resources efficiently scored higher. \n\n3. Capacity was determined by testing the limits of user load and data processing before performance degradation. Functions capable of handling higher loads effectively scored better. \n\nScores were then aggregated to provide a comprehensive view of each function's performance and overall software efficiency. The detailed report highlights the strengths and weaknesses identified during the evaluation and offers recommendations for improvement."

Functions with fewer severe faults scored higher.\n\n2. Availability was assessed by measuring the uptime and downtime, with higher scores for functions that are consistently operational.\n\n3. Fault Tolerance was determined by the software's ability to operate correctly despite faults. Functions that maintained performance despite errors scored higher.\n\n4. Recoverability was evaluated based on the effectiveness of the software's mechanisms to recover data and performance levels after faults.\n\nScores were assigned on a scale from 0 to 10 for each criterion, and a total score was calculated for each function. The percentages were derived from the average scores across all functions to provide a comprehensive view of the software's reliability. The detailed report highlights the strengths and weaknesses identified during the evaluation and provides recommendations for improvement."

Each aspect was evaluated based on the presence of mechanisms within the code that support these security features. The scores were assigned based on the observed mechanisms or their absence:\n\n1. **Confidentiality** (2/10): The class does not implement specific access controls, which are crucial for ensuring that data is accessible only to authorized users. The score reflects the minimal inherent confidentiality provided by Python's class structure.\n\n2. **Integrity** (3/10): There is no explicit mechanism to ensure data integrity such as checksums or hashes. The score is given for the basic data handling that might prevent accidental corruption.\n\n3. **Non-repudiation** (1/10): The class lacks mechanisms such as logging or transaction recording that could support non-repudiation.\n\n4. **Accountability** (2/10): Without logging or detailed error handling, it's challenging to trace actions back to an entity. Minimal accountability is inferred from the structured approach to data handling.\n\n5. **Authenticity** (1/10): There are no methods to verify the identity of a user or process, which is critical for many security-sensitive applications.\n\nThe detailed report provides a summary of strengths, weaknesses, and actionable recommendations to enhance the security posture of the software project."
