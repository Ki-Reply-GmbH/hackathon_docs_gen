You are a software engineer assistant. You are given a directory containing multiple coding files for a complete software project. \
I want to find the systems External sources. Your tasks are defined by the following instructions. Follow them precisely. \

1. Choose one file from the directory.

2. Identify all the **key external sources** which are interacting with the file. For example, external sources may include:
 
 a. "" Software Users "" - Software users are individuals or entities that interact with a software application for various purposes. \
    These users can be categorized based on their roles, expertise, and the way they engage with the software. For example, End Users, \
    Power Users, Administrators, Developers, Testers/QA (Quality Assurance), Support/Help Desk and Stakeholders.

 b. "" Logs "" - Logs in a software project are records of events, actions, and data generated by the software as it runs. They serve \
    as a detailed trail of activity that can be used for monitoring, debugging, auditing, and analyzing the behavior of the software.  \
    For example, Error Logs, Warning Logs, Info Logs, Debug Logs, Audit Logs etc.

 c. "" Databases "" - Databases are foundational components in software systems, enabling efficient data storage, retrieval, and management \
    across  various applications and industries. For examples, some of the renowned databases are MySQL, AZURE CosmosDB, MariaDB, MongoDB etc.

 d. "" Monitoring systems "" - Monitoring systems are tools and processes used to observe, track, and manage the performance, health, and \
    security of various components within an IT infrastructure or application environment. These systems provide real-time insights, alerting, \
    and analysis to ensure that systems run smoothly and efficiently, helping organizations to detect and address issues proactively. \
    For example, different types of monitoring systems can be : IT Infrastructure Monitoring, Application Performance Monitoring (APM), Network \
    Monitoring, Security Monitoring, Database Monitoring etc.

 e. "" Data ingestion pipelines "" - Data ingestion pipelines are a set of processes and tools used to collect, import, process, and transfer data \
    from  various sources into a storage system where it can be used for analysis, reporting, or further processing. These pipelines ensure that data \
    flows efficiently and reliably from source systems to destination systems, enabling organizations to make data-driven decisions. For example, \
    Apache Kafka, Amazon Kinesis, Databricks, Azure Delta Lake, Azure synapse analytics etc.

 f. "" API "" - APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, are sets of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate \
    and interact with each other. APIs define the methods and data structures that developers can use to interact with the functionality of a software \
    component, be it a web service, library, operating system, or other applications. For example, Web APIs, Library/Framework APIs, Operating System APIs, \
    Database APIs, Hardware APIs etc.

3. Explain the purpose of each identified external source and why it interacts with this file.

4. Describe the connections and interactions between these external sources and the chosen file.

Now provide a precise ""Description"" briefly for each of these external sources which are present on the file and be careful of one thing if there is a library \
which is present locally, "DO NOT IDENTIFY IT AS AN EXTERNAL SOURCE". Follow the Description Structure given bellow:


### File Content:

{file_content}



### Description Structure ###

1. [Name of the external source 1 ] - summary ...

2. [Name of the external source 2 ] - summary ...
 
3. [Name of the external source 2 ] - summary ...
